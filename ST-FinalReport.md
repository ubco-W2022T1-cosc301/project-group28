# Research Question
I would like to find out relationsips 1) between  age of the player with position and performance and then 2) using specific stats that comprise the main attributes : Shooting(SHO), Pace(PAC), Physical (PHY), Defence (DEF), Dribbling(DRI) and Passing(PAS).

# Introduction

# Exploratory Data Analysis

# Question 1 - Relationship Between Age and Performance
To find out a relationship between age and performance, we use a simple scatter plot with age on y-axis and player performance or overall rating on the x-axis.
We can clearly see a linear positive relationship as age increases, overall increases but we do see an overplot in certain regions indicating that most of the players are in that overall and age reqion.

# Question 2 - Using specific stats with Age and Performance
We took a few different plots to see the specific differences between stats and overall and age
a) Heatmap of Overall, Shooting Attributes and Age: a positive correlation with age and shot power (indicating an increase in shot power with age) and shooting attributes with overall 
b) Dristribution of Player Age and Overall with Dribbling Rating: shows that the dribbling rating usually peaks around age 24-27 and tends to drop after that age.
c) Specific Age and Overall vs ATT, DEF, PAC, PHY, DRI, and PAS plots are shown on Dashboard3, interesting trends such as a positive correlation relationship between technical attributes (ATT, DEF, DRI, PAS) while there is a negative correlation with PHY and PAC attributes with an exception in Strength as age increases.
