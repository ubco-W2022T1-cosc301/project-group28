This data set was found on kaggle.com from the author, BRYANB. The author was able to procure the date from another website called [Sofifa](https://sofifa.com/) which houses data about players and teams from various FIFA games and this dataset includes 16000+ unique player stats from FIFA 22. <br />
This data consists of aggregated data such as name of the players, age, country and detailed data such as offensive potential, defense, acceleration.
The dataset we use is specifically for the FIFA 22 game and was updated last on October 2022. <br />
The purpose of using this dataset was for fun and it was easy to understand. This dataset could also be valuble to learn exploratory data analysis.<br />
This data was collected using beautifulsoup from the website [Sofifa](https://sofifa.com/). General information from was scraped from the main page and each player's webpage was scraped individually. This was done by defining a batch size to parallelize the retrieving of data and then the dataframes were merged and cleaned.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

<div style="text-align: justify;">

We hope to learn the basics of data analysis and learn how FIFA rates their players. We also hope to get meaningful experience working with large datatsets for our future careers. We chose this dataset as we have been interested in FIFA and football(soccer) for a long time and working with this dataset lets us analyse a topic of interest for us. We would like to answer questions like which country or position has the highest average sprint speed or which country has the heaviest players. To be able to build a user-facing Dashboard using this dataset would be a great achievement and would allow fans of the sport and game to experience it.
